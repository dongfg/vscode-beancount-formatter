## Development

- [format.ts](src/format.ts) was rewrite from beancount's [format.py](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/blob/master/beancount/scripts/format.py)
- `yarn test` run testCase copy from [format_test.py](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/blob/master/beancount/scripts/format_test.py)
- The test helper file `helper.ts` depends on `bean-format` command, so you need to install `beancount` with pip
